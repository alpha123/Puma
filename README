Puma is a new, speedy, CSS selector engine. Lightweight and designed to be easily dropped into any library, Puma supports all CSS2 and most CSS3 selectors. It has some notable pseudoclasses missing though (like :nth-child).

It's syntax is just like Sizzle and friends:

Puma(selector[, DOMElement])


It's also very extensible: you can add new pseudoclasses or operators any time you want. Let's say we want to define the @ operator to be like the # operator except matching name instead of id:

Puma.operators.unary['@'] = function (elem, right) {
    return elem.getAttribute('name') == right.value;
};

More documentation on doing this will be available sometime when I get around to it (hopefully within the next few years :-P).
